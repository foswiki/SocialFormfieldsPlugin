---++ Description

This plugin implenents so-called "social formfields" for ratings and votings.
While normal/non-social formfields such as =select=, =rating=, or =radio= only
allow to store a single value per formfield of a [[%SYSTEMWEB%.DataForms][data
form]], social formfields captures values for each user individually that
edited the topic. 

Whenever user A edits a topic with a =socialrating= formfield in the attached
!DataForm will he see and edit his _own_ value. User B won't be able to change
the value that user A has entered when it is his turn to edit the topic.
Instead, values added by all users will be stored in a database behind the
scene that holds the personal values of each user. These will be swapped in and
out during an edit-save cycle. When displaying the topic it will show an average rating
among all ratings performed by all users, or the best selection performed via a
=socialradio= or =socialselect= formfield. Values can also be extracted in json
form to be used in Foswiki:Extensions/HighchartsPlugin or the like to render a bar chart of the
distribution. 

---++ Usage

Social formfields can be configured like their non-social counterpart.
